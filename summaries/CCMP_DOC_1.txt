Here is a concise summary of the text:

**Cybersecurity Crisis Management**

Cybersecurity is a critical issue for organizations, with many companies affected by mass destruction due to cyber security incidents. Effective crisis management involves a combination of preventive, detective, and reactive processes to deal with security crises.

**Purpose of the Plan**

The plan aims to establish a strategic framework for preparing for, responding to, and coordinating from a cyber-incident. It provides guidelines for planning and preparation for incident handling, team structure, and steps to take during the first hour and first 24 hours.

**Types of Cyber Crises**

The plan identifies different types of threats and crises, including:

* Events (observable occurrences in a system or network)
* Security incidents (adverse events that pose a threat to computer or network security)
* Cyber security crises (situations where security characters of information are compromised)

**Threat Landscape**

The threat landscape is changing, with advanced persistent threats (APT) and targeted attacks becoming increasingly sophisticated. These attacks use public information to develop a complete picture of the target organization and exploit vulnerabilities in client-side applications.

**Key Points**

* The plan requires regular updates, preferably once a year
* The approach and methodology are based on CERT-In guidelines
* The plan includes a section on contingency planning for IT systems and a review of cyber-attack methodologies for modification of the plan.
